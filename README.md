# UCSB Theta Tau

Website for UCSB's co-engineering fraternity Theta Tau.


### Prerequisites

The CSS files are created using SASS/SCSS. Please download or find a good sass preprocessor (I used prepos). If not, you could write everything in CSS if you really want to.

## Folder Setup

In the views folder, there's different subfolders for certain assets such as members images and job images. The SCSS files outside of the views folder will update the css files in the views/styles folder. If you want to change this just copy the scss files and set it up how you like with your css preprocessor. Make sure all the stylesheets link to the correct files.

## Deployment

It's setup to heroku so anything that is pushed to master will display on the website.

## Contributing

Send a pull request and the collaborators will check it over and approve it for merge.
