# UCSB Theta Tau

Website for UCSB's co-engineering fraternity Theta Tau.


### Prerequisites

The CSS files are created using SASS/SCSS. Please download or find a good sass preprocessor (I used prepos). If not, you could write everything in CSS if you really want to.

## Deployment

It's setup to heroku so anything that is pushed to master will display on the website.

## Contributing

Send a pull request and the collaborators will check it over and approve it for merge.
